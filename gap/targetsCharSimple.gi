## The pregenerated list TargetsCharSimple will contain the following information in form of tupels of any group
## (T x T x ... x T), where T is a non-abelian simple group,
## with group order up to the maximum index boundary max_index.
## Let Q be such a group of interest, then the information about Q will be consisting of the following:
## 1 : the group order
## 2 : the primes dividing the schur multiplier of Q
## 3 : name of the group T^d
## The list TargetsCharSimple is sorted by information 1.
