## The pregenerated list TargetsQuotient will contain the following information in form of tupels of any subgroup Q of
## Aut(T x T x ... x T), where T is a non-abelian simple group,
## such that (T x T x ... x T) is a subgroup of Q and Q acts transitively on the copies of T,
## with group order up to the maximum index boundary max_index.
## Let Q be such a group of interest, then the information about Q will be consisting of the following:
## 1 : the group order
## 2 : an index of some group S, that has trivial core in Q
## 3 : name of the group T^d
## The list TargetsQuotient is sorted by information 1.
